# 31daysofhalloween

## What will this be?
Every October I create a horror/Halloween themed film festival for myself called The 31 Days of Halloween. I typically watch anywhere from 10 - 20 movies and like to keep track of what I've watched from year to year. At the moment I store all this data in Google Sheets, but I'd like it to be more interactive and possible something with a community attached. 

## Built in Django!
The goal is for the whole app to run in Django with possibly a third-party API or two. Will likely add Bootstrap to make the front end look pretty.
